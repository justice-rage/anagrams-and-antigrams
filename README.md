# _Anagram Checker_

#### By _**Justice Douglas**_

#### _A project that compares words and sentences to check if they are anagrams, antigrams or words at all._

## Technologies Used

* _Ruby_
* _rspec_
* _pry_

## Description

_This project compares words and sentences to check if they are anagrams, antigrams or words at all._

_Two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in a different order. For example, "ruby" and "bury" are anagrams because they contain the same letters._

_If phrases aren't anagrams, the method checks whether they are actually "antigrams." For our purposes, a word is an "antigram" of another word if letters from the two inputs do not match. For example, "hi" has no matches with "bye"._

_If you are curious you can run this program in your terminal by following the instructions below._
